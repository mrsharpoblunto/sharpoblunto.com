Just some quick updates and cross promotionalizing, I’ve been doing a lot of work recently in generating procedural content for Junkship, I’ve written a post on what I’ve been up to on [here](http://www.junkship.net/News/2011/11/13/building-steam-with-a-grain-of-salt). Also released a few updates to my gamedev framework [MGDF](https://github.com/mrsharpoblunto/MGDF) (which coincidentally Junkship is using). Apart from that the main thing sucking up all my time these days is finalizing the details for my move to San Francisco for my new job in January. There really is a huge partially hidden tree of dependencies that have to be satisfied when moving your life halfway across the world, the complexity of which can only become obvious the further down into the details you delve.
