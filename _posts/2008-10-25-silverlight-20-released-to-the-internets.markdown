I've just finished work on upgrading my Silverlight based amazon search engine app &quot;Tarantula&quot; to use the final release of Silverlight 2.0. Its taken a year and a half since what was first known as Silverlight 1.1 was released as an alpha ([and coincidentally my first blog post here](/News/2007/07/16/regarding-silverlight-services-and-somesuch)) to this latest release. In that intervening time I've had to upgrade the application 4 times to alpha refresh, [beta 1](/News/2008/04/16/silverlight-redux), and [beta 2](/News/2008/07/11/silverlight-one-step-forward-one-step-sideways) and finally to the release version. 

To be honest, this latest upgrade was probably the simplest, as there were relatively few breaking changes between beta 2 and the final release, owing to the fact that Silverlight had become pretty mature and fully featured by the time the second beta rolled around. If your interested, check out Tarantula [here](http://tarantula.sharpoblunto.com) and see the results of my efforts and frustrations :)
