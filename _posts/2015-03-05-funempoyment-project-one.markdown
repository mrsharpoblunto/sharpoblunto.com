Through a complicated and not particularly interesting sequence of events I've ended up with a few weeks of (f)unemployment in between my last [incredible journey](http://ourincrediblejourney.tumblr.com) and my next job. Rather than let this opportunity go to waste I'm planning on filling my time with a few projects I've been meaning to get around to doing.

Heres project #1 - my attempt at a pixel art rendering of Hong Kong.
